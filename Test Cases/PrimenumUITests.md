# **Manual Tests for the prime number checker algorithm

**Test Case 1**
1. Attempt to pass in a set of decimal values (e.g. 1.23, 3.45, 2.34). The real time input validation process will indicate that one of the numbers is not an integer and thus not allow for the calculation to occur

**Test Case 2**
2. Attempt to pass in a set of values matching the maximum number of characters allowed for the set of inputs. The numbers will be identified correctly and within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. less than 3 minutes)

**Test Case 3**
3. Attempt to pass in a mix of negative integers and positive values. All of the negative integers will be identified as non-prime with an error message: "At least one negative number was inputted, but only the non-negative numbers will be considered".
